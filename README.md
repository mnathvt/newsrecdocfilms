Insight project files

The IMDB list is obtained from https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/
I used the title.basics.tsv file as my data.
Total number of entries in this file: 5570541

For this work, selected only those titles which are written in English and in the year range 1970-present (2019), last ~50 years.
Considered only the start year of the films.

Dropped those titles for which the plot summary does not exist on IMDB. This further reduces the number of films in the list.
The final version of the dataset contains ~100,000 titles with description with start year in 1970s onwards.

Used Google pre-trained word2vec model (available https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/).

The plot show the increase of number of documentary films over the years, there is a steep increase since 2010.
The plot goes down to 0 for 2020, because of no records!
